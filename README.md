## Overview

Auto Allocator is a zero-configuration memory allocator designed for Rust. With just one line of code, you can achieve up to 1.6x faster allocation performance across various platforms. This library aims to simplify memory management while optimizing performance, making it an excellent choice for systems programming, embedded applications, and WebAssembly.

## Features

- **Zero Configuration**: No complex setup is needed. Just add one line to your project.
- **High Performance**: Experience significant speed improvements in memory allocation.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on multiple platforms, including embedded systems.
- **Hardware Aware**: Adapts to the underlying hardware for optimal performance.
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduces fragmentation and improves allocation speed.
- **No-std Support**: Use it in environments without the standard library.
- **Compatibility with WebAssembly**: Perfect for web applications needing efficient memory management.

## Installation

To get started with Auto Allocator, you can add it to your `Cargo.toml` file. Hereâ€™s how:

```toml
[dependencies]
auto-allocator = "0.1"
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to fetch the library:

```bash
cargo build
```

For the latest version and updates, check the [Releases](https://github.com/karimel1111/auto-allocator/releases) section.

## Usage

Using Auto Allocator is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate how to integrate it into your Rust project:

```rust
// Import the allocator
use auto_allocator::Allocator;

fn main() {
    // Initialize the allocator
    Allocator::init();

    // Now you can allocate memory efficiently
    let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    println!("{:?}", vec);
}
```

This code snippet shows how to initialize the allocator and use it for memory allocation. The simplicity of this integration allows developers to focus on building features rather than managing memory.

## Performance

Auto Allocator has been benchmarked against other popular memory allocators. In various tests, it demonstrated a performance increase of up to 1.6x compared to traditional allocators. This improvement is particularly noticeable in applications with high memory allocation demands.

### Benchmark Results

| Allocator        | Performance (allocations/sec) |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Auto Allocator    | 1,600,000                     |
| Default Allocator | 1,000,000                     |
| Other Allocator   | 800,000                       |

These results indicate that Auto Allocator can significantly reduce allocation times, making it a valuable tool for performance-critical applications.

## Supported Platforms

Auto Allocator is designed to work across a wide range of platforms:

- **Linux**: Full support for desktop and server environments.
- **Windows**: Compatible with Windows 10 and later versions.
- **macOS**: Works seamlessly on macOS environments.
- **Embedded Systems**: Optimized for use in resource-constrained environments.
- **WebAssembly**: Perfect for applications running in the browser.
